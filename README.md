## Integration Process

TVNexa integrates comprehensive electronic program guide (EPG) data seamlessly into its platform. This integration process is handled by Jobs managed by Quartz, a robust job scheduling framework known for its reliability and scalability. These Quartz Jobs efficiently retrieve and store information in a MariaDB Galera cluster utilizing Jetbrains Exposed for streamlined data management.

Additionally, TVNexa has developed an API powered by the Ktor framework, ensuring high-performance and rapid access to stored information. This API utilizes Redis Cluster as a caching system, enabling lightning-fast data retrieval from the MariaDB Galera storage.
